# NOSQL

* NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and hi gh user loads.

## Types of NoSQL

1. Document databases
1. Key-value stores
1. Column-oriented databases
1. Graph databases

* Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects, and their structures typically align with objects developers are working with in code.

* Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.Key-value databases are great for use cases where you need to store large amounts of data but you donâ€™t need to perform complex queries to retrieve it. Common use cases include storing user preferences or caching. Redis and DynanoDB are popular key-value databases.

* Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. Wide-column stores provide a lot of flexibility over relational databases because each row is not required to have the same columns. Many consider wide-column stores to be two-dimensional key-value databases.

* Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.

## WHY TO USE NoSQL

* The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database.

* The structure of many different forms of data is more easily handled and evolved with a NoSQL database.

* The amount of data in many applications cannot be served affordably by a SQL database.

* New application paradigms can be more easily supported.
